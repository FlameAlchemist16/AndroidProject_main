### Course_Schedule_Tracker

#### Over View

* *Intro*
> As a college student, I have an enormous pressure to manage everything, be it studies, projects, lectures, and side activities like developing skills, managing club activities, etc. In addressing all these kinds of stuff and trying to do our best, I often face difficulties keeping track of each and everything. Also, every student must have met or is facing such a scenario in their life.
> To cope with this scenario, I am trying to develop an application that keeps track of your scheduled meetings and lectures.\

#### Main Idea

> This application needs you to provide some information regarding your appointments, such as Date, Day, starting time. Then this app will keep track of the time, and just before the time, it will ask you to choose whether to join the meeting or not. If yes, it will only open the corresponding app, and if no, then it will terminate the reminder.
